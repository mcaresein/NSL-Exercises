This folder contains a code for simulation of the Ising model.
There are 2 helper scripts
1) run.sh: run the simulation at a single temperature;
2) T_Helper.sh: wraps up run.sh in order to run the simulation of interesting thermodynamical quantities at different temperatures.

Default parameters set up a quite expensive computation. More details in the accompanying notebook.

Input files follow the same rationale as in Exercise04
